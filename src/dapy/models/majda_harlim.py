    """Linear SPDE model on a periodic 1D spatial domain for turbulent signals.

    This model class represents the state field by its the Fourier coefficients rather
    than values of the state field at the spatial mesh points.

    Based on the stochastic model for turbulent signals described in Chapter 5 of [1].

    The governing stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) is

        dX = (α * ∂²X/∂s² + β * ∂X/∂s - γ * X) dt + κ ⊛ dW

    where `s` is the spatial coordinate in a periodic domain `[0, S)`, `t` the time
    coordinate, `X(s, t)` the state field process, `α` a coefficient controlling the
    degree of diffusion in the dynamics, `β` a coefficient controlling the degree of
    linear advection in the dynamics,  `γ` a coefficient controlling the degree of
    damping in the dynamics, `W(s, t)` a space-time white noise process, `κ(s)` a
    spatial smoothing kernel and `⊛` indicates circular convolution in the spatial
    coordinate.

    Using a spectral spatial discretisation with `M` mesh points, this corresponds to a
    linear system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in the Fourier
    coefficients X̃ₖ

        dX̃ₖ = (-α * ωₖ² - γ + i * β * ωₖ) * X̃ₖ + κ̃ₖ * dW̃ₖ  ∀ k ∈ {0, ..., M/2}

    where `W̃ₖ` is a complex-valued Wiener process, `κ̃ₖ` the kth Fourier coefficient of
    the smoothing kernel `κ`, `ωₖ = 2 * π * k / S` the kth spatial frequency and `i`
    the imaginary unit.

    This time-homogenous linear system of SDES in the Fourier coefficients can be solved
    exactly, giving a complex normal transition probability

        X̃ₖ(t) | X̃ₖ(0) ~ ComplexNormal(exp((-ψₖ + i * β * ωₖ) * t) * X̃ₖ(0),
                                      (1 - exp(-2 * ψₖ * t)) * κ̃ₖ² / (2 * ψₖ))

    where `ψₖ = α * ωₖ² + γ`, and a stationary distribution

        X̃ₖ(∞) ~ ComplexNormal(0, κ̃ₖ² / (2 * ψₖ))

    The smoothing kernel Fourier coefficients are assumed to be

        κ̃ₖ = σ * exp(-ωₖ² * ℓ²) * √(M / S)

    where `σ` is a parameter controlling the amplitude and `ℓ` a parameter controlling
    the length scale.
