"""Cython wrapper for network simplex algorithm optimal transport solver.

Derived from files emd_wrapper.pyx and EMD_wrapper.cpp in the Python
Optimal Transport (POT) library by Remi Flammary
    https://github.com/rflamary/POT
The EMD_wrapper.cpp file was itself originally written by Antoine Rolet as
a wrapper around code written by Nicolas Boneel available at
    https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/nicolas.bonneel/FastTransport/
which itself is based on an implementation of the network simplex algorithm
extracted from the C++ graph-based optimisation library LEMON
    http://lemon.cs.elte.hu/trac/lemon

Compared to the POT implementation this adds support for calculating a batch
of OT problems of the same dimensions in parallel using OpenMP and allows use
of non-C-contiguous arrays for the source and target histograms and cost
matrices by using memoryview interfaces to abstract indexing of the arrays.

    source_dist and target_dist are 1D arrays of shape (n_source,) and
    (n_target,) respectively with non-negative entries which specify the
    source and target distributions to solve an optimal transport problem for.
    For the optimal transport problem to have a solutions it is necessary that
        sum(target_dist) == sum(source_dist)
    i.e. that the source and target distributions sum to the same value.
    Typically both arrays will represent probability distributions and sum to
    one however technically the only requirement is that the total 'mass' in
    both arrays is the same such that there exists a valid transport plan to
    transport all the mass from the sources to targets.

    cost_matrix is a 2D array of shape (n_source, n_target) with the entry
    cost_matrix[s, t] specifying the cost of moving the s'th source to the
    t'th target. Typically the entries will correspond to some distrance
    measure between the underlying points representing the source and targets.

    Args:
        source_dists (1D array): Array of source distribution to solve for of
            shape (n_source,).
        target_dists (1D array): Array of target distribution to solve for of
            shape (n_target,).
        cost_matrices (2D array): Array of cost matrix to solve for of shape
            (n_source, n_target).
        max_iter (int): Maximum number of iterations to run network simplex
            algorithm for.
        sum_diff_tolerance (double): Tolerance for check on equality of sums of
            target and source distribution entries.

    Returns:
        trans_matrix (2D array): Computed optimal transport matrix of shape
            (n_source, n_target).
        cost (double): Computed optimal expected transport cost.
        results_code (int): Integer results code indicating outcome of running
            network simplex algorithm on optimal transport problem. The
            integer code can be translated to a string description using the
            get_result_code_strings function. A value of 1 indicates the
            solver converged to an optimal solution for the problem.
