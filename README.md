# Data assimilation in Python

Python code for data assimilation inference methods and test models.

The models implemented include

  * a one-dimensional discrete-time model with non-linear dynamics commonly used as a particle filter test problem and originally proposed by Netto et al. (1978),
  * a three-dimensional ordinary differential equation model with chaotic dynamics proposed by Lorenz (1963),
  * a toy atmospherical dynamics model on a one-dimensional spatial domain, commonly used as an example of spatio-temporal chaos in the data assimilation literature, proposed by Lorenz (1996),
  * a linear advection-diffusion stochastic partial differential equation model of turbulence on a one-dimensional periodic spatial domain proposed by Majda and Harlim (2012),
  * a non-linear stochastic partial differential equation model on a one-dimensional spatial domain based on the the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation (Kuramoto and Tsuzuki, 1976; Sivashinsky, 1997), a fourth-order non-linear partial differential equation model of instabilities in laminar wave fronts,
  * a non-linear Navier-Stokes stochastic partial differential equation model on a periodic two-dimensional spatial domain.

The inference methods implemented include

  * Kalman filter (Kalman, 1960),
  * stochastic (perturbed observation) ensemble Kalman filter (Evensen, 1994; Bugers, van Leeuwen and Evensen, 1998),
  * ensemble transform (square-root) Kalman filter (Tippett et al., 2003),
  * local ensemble transform Kalman filter (Hunt, Kostelich and Szunyogh, 2007),
  * bootstrap particle filter (Gordon, Salmond and Smith, 1993),
  * particle filter using locally optimal proposal for state space models with additive Gaussian state and observation noise and linear observation operators (Doucet, Godsill and Andrieu, 2000),
  * ensemble transform particle filter (Reich, 2013),
  * local ensemble transform particle filter (Cheng and Reich, 2015),
  * scalable local ensemble transform particle filter (Graham and Thiery, 2019).

Example usages of the models and inference methods are provided in the [Jupyter](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) notebooks in the [`notebooks` directory](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/thiery-lab/data-assimilation/tree/master/notebooks/?flush_cache=true).

## Dependencies

The `dapy` package is intended for use with Python 3.8+. We recommend using a tool such as [Conda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) to create an isolated Python 3 virtual environment to install the package and its dependencies in. The minimal requirements for using the inference methods and model classes implemented in the `dapy` package are [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) and [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/). Appropriate versions of these packages will be installed automatically when [installing the package using `pip`](#installing-the-dapy-package).

To install the depedencies manually in a Conda environment run

    conda install numpy scipy numba

or using pip

    pip install numpy scipy numba

The ensemble transport particle filter inference methods require solving optimal transport problems. A C++ extension module (written in Cython) wrapping a network simplex linear programming based exact solver from [the C++ graph library LEMON](https://lemon.cs.elte.hu/trac/lemon) is included in the `dapy.ot` sub-package. Alternatively if available, solvers from the [Python Optimal Transport](http://pot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library can be used. To install in the current environment run

```
conda install -c conda-forge pot
```

or using pip with

```
pip install POT
```

The [PyFFTW](http://pyfftw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) may also optionally be used for more efficient fast Fourier transform computations in models using spectral expansions - install using

```
conda install -c conda-forge pyfftw
```

or using pip with

```
pip install pyfftw
```

The example [Jupyter](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) notebooks includes plots produced using [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/). To be able to run the notebooks locally the following additional packages should be installed with conda using

    conda install jupyter matplotlib

or using pip with

    pip install jupyter matplotlib


## Installing the `dapy` package

The package includes several [Cython](http://cython.org/) extension modules which are provided as both Cython and C / C++ source. To build the extensions directly from the C / C++ source files (which does not require Cython to be installed) run

```
python setup.py build_ext
```

To build the extensions using Cython (install with `conda install cython` or `pip install cython`) run

```
python setup.py build_ext --use-cython
```

This will build the extension modules directly from the Cython source files and using Cython optimisations which give performance improvements at the cost of less safe array access (these can be disabled with optional argument `--no-cython-opts`).

The `dapy` package can then be installed in to the current environment by running

```
pip install .
```

or to install in editable mode

```
pip install -e .
```
